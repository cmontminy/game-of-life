A program that simulates [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It currently opens a 1900 x 950 window with 100 random cells actively placed. It then follows the rules of the game to update the cells every second until the program is closed.

The folder `drawing-panel` implements this using Java's drawing panel class.

The folder `gol_processing` implements this using the Processing graphics library and was written by [Skyler (Dinoswarleafs)](https://github.com/Dinoswarleafs).
